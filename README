== Zebes CSS
Zebes CSS is a template I started to help me create applications
that resemble Basecamp.

No, I'm not writing project collaboration software.  I just simply
wanted a quick and easy CSS template that gave me a similar look.

I think 37Signals has done an awesome job and laying out a great UI
for their users.  It's simple and clean.  Tabs, links, and the "sheet"
style.

I'm not a designer by trade, just a C# / Ruby guy that enjoys coding.
I'm sure there are issues with the template.  Which is why I'm 
releasing it as open source.
